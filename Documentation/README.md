This repository is a testament to my advanced Postman skills for in-depth API testing.

Key Highlights:

Postman Techniques Mastery: Leverage Pre-request Scripts for streamlined test setup, Test Scripts for robust response validation, and all types of Postman variables for enhanced reusability and maintainability across environments.
Environment Management: Seamlessly manage API configurations for various stages (development, staging, production) with multiple environments.
CLI Integration for Automation: Run Postman collections efficiently from the command line using both Postman CLI and Newman, a powerful tool for continuous integration.
